### ‰Ω†Â•ΩÔºÅ üëã

I'm an electrical engineer at Meta. I was previously at [GoPro](https://gopro.com) making action cameras, and [Swift Navigation](https://www.swiftnav.com) building fun little modules give you amazingly precise positioning.

I am also part of the [Clement Collective](https://clementcollective.org/) in the Richmond District of San Francisco, a multi-media art collective open to all walks of life. 
Hit me up if you're into:
- Making art or graphics for zines and/or newsletters
- Building or making music with synths
- Building games on a [Playdate](https://play.date)
- English to Traditional Chinese translation (zh-TW)
- Dreaming about starting a pop-up restaurant everyday during food-coma
