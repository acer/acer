I'm an electrical engineer at [Swift Navigation](https://www.swiftnav.com), building fun little [modules](https://www.swiftnav.com/precision-gnss-module) and [full-blown products](https://www.swiftnav.com/piksi-multi) that give you amazingly precise positioning.

Hit me up if you're into collabing on
